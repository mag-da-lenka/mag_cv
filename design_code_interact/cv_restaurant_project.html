    <!-- <p>
    ** While working on my redesign, it turned out that some features of the website started to change and I
    soon got the confirmation that it was to be rebuilt soon so I included samples of the page in this folio. Please
    feel free to contact me if necessary because the page has drastically changed its funcionality and aestetics.

        <h2>DESIGN PROCESS HIGHLIGHTS</h2> <br>

        <h3>DOUBLE DIAMOND: DISCOVERY and DEFINITION of issues </h3>
        <h4> <br> HEURISTIC EVALUATION </h4>
        <li>
          using Jacob Nielsen's
          10 general principles for interaction design
        </li>
        <h4> <br> QUALITATIVE and QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH: </h4>
        <li>
          stakeholder's interview, 1:1 sessions, card sorting, <br>
          desktop research, surveys, comparative research, testing
        </li>
        <li>
          <button class="accordion">
            a few practical examples
          </button class="accordion">
          <div class="panel"> <br>
            10 HEURISTICS ANALYSIS resulted in a long list of major and minor issues of various priorities. <br>
            EXAMPLES:
            only partial and non-clickable breadcrumbs ||
            confusing 'menu' link: unclear which one is on-site /catering /take-away ||
            some images (hoverable and clickable) open the same the page in a new tab: counterintuitive ||
            a mix of Danish and English phrases ||
            maker-centric language (eg. biodynamic raw materials) ||
            too much cognitive and memory load (lengthy articles) ||
            content hierarchy on the landing page is unclear ||
            home page: 3 chaotic animations line by line equals lost focus ||
            typography and colour inconsistencies break internal standards ||
            low quality pictures, uneven sizes ||
            overanimated navigation blurs the overall message ||
            distracting, competive slogans without a particular order ||
            weak mistake prevention: light grey submit button that looks 'inactive' but works ||
            <br>
            <br>
            1:1 SESSIONS provided evidence, eg. noone understood the word 'biodynamic' and all testees were confused by
            the
            clickable pictures that weren't links to gallery but opened the landing page in new tab.
            <br>
            <br>
            STAKEHOLDER'S INTERVIEW: The owner turned to be a friendly person with true passion for vegan food and
            abundance
            of positive energy. There was a survey, the meeting took an hour. The questions and tasks focused on 4
            issues:
            1) What is the place all about? 2) Who are the guests? 3) Business goals for the nearest future 4) What is
            the purpose of the website in the context of the business goals?
            <br>
            <br>
            CARD SORTING was helpful in detecting how to organize the navigation to make all desired content easily
            discoverable and accessible.
            The cards with pages' titles (initial sitemap, but 'sliced') were given to each testee separately and then
            they
            decided together which of the 3 sets should be the final hierarchy.

        </h3>


        <li>
          There was a number of issues to be solved on every level but
          due to the limited feasibility at that time
          I have chosen to focus on the landing page and the
          menu page as crucial to achieve <span class="yellow"> PRIORITY GOALS </span>:

        <li>
          <div class="char_desaturated"> &#128161;</span>attract new audience and promote a certain lifestyle

            <span class="char_desaturated"> &#128161;</span>improve usability and accessibility for wide audience (incl.
            non-tech savvy)
            <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; convey clearly the core values mentioned during the stakeholder's interview <br>

            hierarchy and typography)

        <h3>DOUBLE DIAMOND: DEVELOPMENT AND DELIVERY</h3>

        <h4> <br> 1. INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE DESIGN: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> <br>
            <span class="yellow">1.1 SITEMAP </span>
            was created anew after card sorting and after multiple 1:1 sessions on wireframes

            <span class="yellow">1.2 WIREFRAMES</span>
            (from rough sketches to full new structure)
            were created after card sorting and 1:1 sessions and
            there were multiple iterations and testing all over again

        <h4> 2. CONTENT WRITING: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            done anew to simplify the language and shorten the articles

        <h4> 3. AESTHETICS: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Visual design done anew followed by further 1:1 sessions to test it so that the final result is very
            different from the initial moodboard shwn below.

      <h2>FULL SCOPE SUMMARIZED </h2>
      <br>

      <h3>a (very few) EXAMPLES OF CHANGES </h3>
      <br>
      <h4> PRIORITY GOALS COVERAGE: </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          &#10004;attract new audience and promote a certain lifestyle <br>
          The last tests of the ready interactive prototype showed positive results in comparison to the initial tests
          on the website before redesign. The message about the purpose of the place was clear, the main slogan (vegan
          restaurant and beyond) proved to increase curiosity and led to further exploration of the site.
          Other reasons why the page has improved in the eyes of the testees are mentioned below and my super long and
          detailed description of the whole process and results that can be accessed via link. Just drop me a message
          :)
          <a class="text_link" href="mailto:magdalena.s.wojtakowska@gmail.com" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">
            magdalena.s.wojtakowska@gmail.com
          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          &#10004; improve usability and accessibility for wide audience (incl. non-tech savvy) <br>
          The tests proved that it was easier for the users to navigate the page and access information due to
          structural changes and user-centric language.
        </li>
        <li>
          &#10004; improve content writing <br>
          The testees understood the core values of the place and were not tired by excessive memory load.
          They did not need to know words like "biodynamic farming" as technical vocabulary was "translated" into
          Everyman's language.
        </li>
        <li>
          &#10004; improve aesthetics (colours, contrasts, conventions, visual hierarchy typography) <br>
          That aspect is both technical and subjective. However, the testees chose the final design as 'nicer' and more
          'eye-pleasing' over the page as they saw it before redesign.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>





      <h3>What I've learned: </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The scope of the project was so wide that I'm forced to skip the details,
        but such situations are a good reminder of how important it is to prioritize in order of urgency.
        The factors here are users' needs, stakeholders' dreams, technical feasibility within a time frame and ...
        ... and there's the overworked UXer who is in the middle of it all and has to make decisions.
        Honestly this project was quite hectic because of the time pressure but being able to achieve feasible
        goals and meeting the deadline despite the stress is great boost of self esteem and validation of jumping into
        next UX adventures. Yup. I guess I have learned to trust myself more and exercised persuasion skills.
