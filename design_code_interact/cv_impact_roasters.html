      An interactive online form UX/UI for Impact Roasters to help web users pick the perfect coffee beans

    ** While working on my redesign, it turned out that some features of the website started to change and I
    soon got the confirmation that it was to be rebuilt soon so I included samples of the page in this folio. Please
    feel free to contact me if necessary because the page has drastically changed its funcionality and aestetics.

  <h2>GOALS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Build a new feature needed by the users via feedback to the stakeholders. We want to create a Coffe Match
      Finder: an interactive form for our online customers who want to make informed decisions about buying our amazing
      products.
    </li>
    <li>
      Identify the most important pain points: what makes it difficult to make a desicion about the purchase and how
      might we improve the status quo?
    </li>
    <li>
      Design the form within the current Style Guidelines so that it is consistent with the stylescape of Impact
      Roasters.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>METHODOLOGY HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The Double Diamond <span class="char_desaturated"> &#128142;&#128142; </span> with constant iteration and
      testing, user-centered design and empathy.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stakeholder's interview, 1:1 interviews, persona creation. Wireframes, interactive prototype, visual design,
      UX writing. Testing and implementing changes on each iteration.
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h2>PEOPLE and TOOLS </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Human helpers: users, test particiants, stakeholders and developers. The group that participated in the tests
      included existent and potential new users as well as team members. Thank you all for letting me use the group
      picture with your lovely faces!
    </li>
    <li>
      Tools: Figma, an old pencil, a few crayons and some paper. A lot of great coffee.
    </li>
  </ul>



  <h2>DESIGN PROCESS HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
  <br>

  <h3>DOUBLE DIAMOND: discovery and definition phase </h3>
  <br>

  <h4>Status Quo evaluation</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We have a functioning
      <a class="text_link" href="https://impactroasters.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>
      and a working prototype done in React.js by our brave devs, but no UX yet.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <figcaption style="text-align: right;">
      Form (proto version before I took over) <br> <br>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We have feedback from the users via our stakeholders that a form is needed to simplify and speed up the
      process of buying online to make an informed decision.
    </li>
    <li>
      As a UX person and an absolute coffee noob, I have access to a lot of information about bean types,
      methods of brewing and all kind of magic I am not aware yet. All that is accessible directly from Impact
      Roasters Team, the website and various leaflets. I can also happily get caffeinated at the premises.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </figure>



  <h4>Status Quo on a closer look</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      There is a lot of information to process for someone who is a beginner. That is a great thing, but can be
      overwhelming so it seems like we might make it more concise by cherry picking the most crucial bits. What is
      important to know in order not to exceed our cognitive load? We will find out.
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h4>Status Quo: the form prototype I am to work with</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The phrasing is a bit difficult for me. I got stuck at the 1st question not sure what is meant. After all, I am a
      beginner but so might be any other user. Shall we translate the maker-centric language into something easier to
      follow? I am sure we can.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is no progress bar yet so I am not sure how long the form is. We will certainly add the bar.
    </li>
    <li>
      The functionality of the form is done by the book so that the user has the escape option to go back and change
      the answer. Mistake prevention: check.
    </li>
    <li>
      The result page is to be discussed but we can use quite a few criteria because we have great input in our JSON
      files! Wohoo! Thats's a great beginning.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h4> Qualitative and quantitative research </h4>
    <li>
      Desktop research, surveys, comparative research, testing.
    </li>
    <li>
      1:1 sessions provided evidence, eg. noone understood the word 'biodynamic' and all testees were confused by
      the clickable pictures that weren't links to gallery but opened the landing page in new tab.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stakeholder's interview: the owner turned to be a friendly person with true passion for vegan food and
      abundance of positive energy. There was a survey, the meeting took an hour. The questions and tasks focused on
      4 issues:
      1) What is the place all about? 2) Who are the guests? 3) Business goals for the nearest future 4) What is
      the purpose of the website in the context of the business goals?
    </li>
    <li>
      Card sorting was helpful in detecting how to organize the navigation to make all desired content easily
      discoverable and accessible.
      The cards with pages' titles (initial sitemap, but 'sliced') were given to each testee separately and then
      they decided together which of the 3 sets should be the final hierarchy.
    </li>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3> DOUBLE DIAMOND: in between: informed re/definition of the pain points and priority goals </h3>
    <br>

    <ul>
      <li>
        There was a number of issues to be solved on every level but due to the limited feasibility at that time
        I have chosen to focus on the landing page and the menu page as crucial to achieve <span class="yellow">
          <span class="char_desaturated"> &#128161;</span> PRIORITY GOALS </span>:
      </li>
      <li>
        attract new audience and promote a certain lifestyle,
        <br>
        improve usability and accessibility for wide audience (incl.
        non-tech savvy),
        <br>
        improve content writing,
        <br>
        convey clearly the core values mentioned during the
        stakeholder's interview,
        <br>
        reduce jargon and shorten lengthy articles,
        <br>
        improve aesthetics (colours, contrasts, conventions, visual
        hierarchy and typography).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>DOUBLE DIAMOND: development and delivery </h3>
    <br>

    <h4>Information architecture design </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Sitemap </span>
        was created anew after card sorting and after multiple 1:1 sessions on wireframes
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="yellow">Wireframes</span>
        (from rough sketches to full new structure)
        were created after card sorting and 1:1 sessions and
        there were multiple iterations and testing all over again
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h4> Content writing </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        All content writing was done anew to simplify the language and shorten the articles. AB tests proved that it
        was the correct decision and the comprehension time was significantly shorter once the changes were applied.
        The positive effect of the switch from maker- to user-centric language was measured on a group of 10 users
        aged
        23-71.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h4> Aesthetics </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Visual design done anew followed by further 1:1 sessions to test it so that the final result is different from
        the initial moodboard shown below. The feedback included the following phrases: 'cozy feel but also modern',
        'elegant, but edgy', 'I like the colour mood', it's less overwhelming than the original'.
      </li>

    </ul>
    <br>


    <h2>FULL SCOPE SUMMARIZED </h2>
    <br>

    <h3>A few examples of changes </h3>
    <br>

    <h4> Priority goals coverage </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        New audience feels attracted to consider a certain lifestyle.
        The last tests of the ready interactive prototype showed positive results in comparison to the initial tests
        on the website before redesign. The message about the purpose of the place was clear, the main slogan (vegan
        restaurant and beyond) proved to increase curiosity and led to further exploration of the site.
        Other reasons why the page has improved in the eyes of the testees are mentioned below and my super long and
        detailed description of the whole process and results that can be discussed in person if you're inerested.
      </li>
      <li>
        Usability and accessibility for wide audience (incl. non-tech savvy users) has been improved.
        The tests proved that it was easier for the users to navigate the page and access information due to
        structural changes and user-centric language.
      </li>
      <li>
        Content writing has boosted reading comprehention.
        The testees understood the core values of the place and were not tired by excessive memory load.
        They did not need to know words like "biodynamic farming" as technical vocabulary was "translated" into
        Everyman's language.
      </li>
      <li>
        Aesthetics boost (colours, contrasts, conventions, visual hierarchy typography) semed appealing to
        the users. That aspect is both technical and subjective. However, the testees chose the final design as
        'nicer' and more 'eye-pleasing' over the page as they saw it before redesign.
      </li>
      <li>
        The stakeholder's interest and user needs have been included to get the best of both perspectives.
        There were no real sacrifices in terms of explaining what the place is all about. We managed to simplify the
        technical language without losing the core message. The users found it much easier to understand that what
        matters for Green Love is that food, but also a certain lifestyle and worldview is what makes the very tissue
        of the place.
      </li>
    </ul>
