          <li>
            audit the main website and decide which elements of the visual identity are to stay
          </li>
          <li>
            build the new visual design on top of existing identity (logo, some of the font-types)
          </li>
          <li>
            UXR and persona development for the toolbox: who are facilitators and what do they need from this website?

          <h2>DESIGN PROCESS HIGHLIGHTS</h2> <br>

          <h3>DOUBLE DIAMOND: DISCOVERY and DEFINITION of issues </h3>
          <h4> <br> HEURISTIC EVALUATION </h4>
          <li>
            using Jacob Nielsen's
            10 general principles for interaction design
          </li>
          <h4> <br> QUALITATIVE and QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH: </h4>
          <li>
            stakeholder's interview, 1:1 sessions, card sorting, <br>
            desktop research, surveys, comparative research, testing
          </li>
          <li>
            <button class="accordion">
              a few practical examples
            </button class="accordion">
            <div class="panel"> <br>
              10 HEURISTICS ANALYSIS resulted in a long list of major and minor issues of various priorities. <br>
              EXAMPLES:
              only partial and non-clickable breadcrumbs ||
              confusing 'menu' link: unclear which one is on-site /catering /take-away ||
              some images (hoverable and clickable) open the same the page in a new tab: counterintuitive ||
              a mix of Danish and English phrases ||
              maker-centric language (eg. biodynamic raw materials) ||
              too much cognitive and memory load (lengthy articles) ||
              content hierarchy on the landing page is unclear ||
              home page: 3 chaotic animations line by line equals lost focus ||
              typography and colour inconsistencies break internal standards ||
              low quality pictures, uneven sizes ||
              overanimated navigation blurs the overall message ||
              distracting, competive slogans without a particular order ||
              weak mistake prevention: light grey submit button that looks 'inactive' but works ||
              <br>
              <br>
              1:1 SESSIONS provided evidence, eg. noone understood the word 'biodynamic' and all testees were confused
              by
              the
              clickable pictures that weren't links to gallery but opened the landing page in new tab.
              <br>
              <br>
              STAKEHOLDER'S INTERVIEW: The owner turned to be a friendly person with true passion for vegan food and
              abundance
              of positive energy. There was a survey, the meeting took an hour. The questions and tasks focused on 4
              issues:
              1) What is the place all about? 2) Who are the guests? 3) Business goals for the nearest future 4) What is
              the purpose of the website in the context of the business goals?
              <br>
              <br>
              CARD SORTING was helpful in detecting how to organize the navigation to make all desired content easily
              discoverable and accessible.
              The cards with pages' titles (initial sitemap, but 'sliced') were given to each testee separately and then
              they
              decided together which of the 3 sets should be the final hierarchy.

            informed re/DEFINITION of the PAIN POINTS and PRIORITY GOALS
          </h3>


          <li>
            There was a number of issues to be solved on every level but
            due to the limited feasibility at that time
            I have chosen to focus on the landing page and the
            menu page as crucial to achieve <span class="yellow"> PRIORITY GOALS </span>:

              (incl.

        <h2>FULL SCOPE SUMMARIZED </h2>
        <br>

        <h3>a (very few) EXAMPLES OF CHANGES </h3>
        <br>
        <h4> PRIORITY GOALS COVERAGE: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            &#10004;attract new audience and promote a certain lifestyle <br>
            The last tests of the ready interactive prototype showed positive results in comparison to the initial tests
            on the website before redesign. The message about the purpose of the place was clear, the main slogan (vegan
            restaurant and beyond) proved to increase curiosity and led to further exploration of the site.
            Other reasons why the page has improved in the eyes of the testees are mentioned below and my super long and
            detailed description of the whole process and results that can be accessed via link. Just drop me a message
            :)
            <a class="text_link" href="mailto:magdalena.s.wojtakowska@gmail.com" target="_blank"

          <li>
            &#10004; improve usability and accessibility for wide audience (incl. non-tech savvy) <br>
            The tests proved that it was easier for the users to navigate the page and access information due to
            structural changes and user-centric language.
          </li>
          <li>
            &#10004; improve content writing <br>
            The testees understood the core values of the place and were not tired by excessive memory load.
            They did not need to know words like "biodynamic farming" as technical vocabulary was "translated" into
            Everyman's language.
          </li>
          <li>
            &#10004; improve aesthetics (colours, contrasts, conventions, visual hierarchy typography) <br>
            That aspect is both technical and subjective. However, the testees chose the final design as 'nicer' and
            more
            'eye-pleasing' over the page as they saw it before redesign.
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What I've learned: </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          The scope of the project was so wide that I'm forced to skip the details,
          but such situations are a good reminder of how important it is to prioritize in order of urgency.
          The factors here are users' needs, stakeholders' dreams, technical feasibility within a time frame and ...
          ... and there's the overworked UXer who is in the middle of it all and has to make decisions.
          Honestly this project was quite hectic because of the time pressure but being able to achieve feasible
          goals and meeting the deadline despite the stress is great boost of self esteem and validation of jumping into
          next UX adventures. Yup. I guess I have learned to trust myself more and exercised persuasion skills.
