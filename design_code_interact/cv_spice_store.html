        <h2>GOALS</h2>
        <li>
          A detailed UX/UI design for the students of
          <a class="text_link" href="https://www.hackyourfuture.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Hack-Your-Future/Copenhagen
          </a>
          coding school that is easy to read and navigate in terms of flows and does not require very advanced knowledge
          of Figma.
        </li>
        <li>
          The design is for a simple online store. I have used very common patterns to maintain usability standars while
          keeping things uncomplicated. The flows work in loops, there are error prevention mechanisms added.

        <h2>CHALLENGES</h2>
        <li>
          Our students are budding developers who are not familiar with Figma yet, so the prototype must be easy to
          follow. On top of it, they will need to figure out how to adapt the prototype for mobile version to prepare
          them for future scenarios when they cannot be guided by a designer or a senior colleague. That is why the
          mobile design is not provided, but I was guiding the students to promote good practices of Responsive Web
          Design.

        <h3>DOUBLE DIAMOND: discovery and definition phase </h3>
        <br>

        <p>
          There is not much discovery involved as the project is relatively simple due to small budget and tight
          deadline. The designer's decision was to use the standard by-the-book solutions that work and are aligned with
          Jacob Nielsen's 10 General Principles for Interaction Design.
        </p>

        <p>UX Research was quite easy and 1:1 sessions with a group of 19 people helped us to understand how we might
          organise spices by categories. Patterns were very clear so that creating the Sitemap and overall
          Information Architecture was fast and satistying. The weird part is that my own ideas how to categorise
          spices are apparently niche. My braing imagines things sweet, spicy, salty, savory etc. It has to do with
          taste. However, the majority prefers to divide spices by use. What most users needed was what kind of dish we
          would use a thing for: a beverage? a salad? 10 out of 19 people considered themselves cooking pros and they
          mentioned that a plant part category would be helpful so that's what we did.
        </p>

        <h3>DOUBLE DIAMOND: development and delivery </h3>
        <br>

        <h4>Information architecture design </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The sitemap is kept as uncomplicated as possible. It is kept flat with the obvious exception of spices
            categories. The navigation is a common usecase for stores with anything account related is kept on top.
            There was not time for rough sketches so I had to draw high-res prototype so finding the right aesthetics
            and feel was the next thing to do.
          </li>
        </ul>


        <h4> Visual Identity </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Our group of 19 were asked to search the internet a little and find images that they would feel like the
            right choice for the spice store: max 4 images of spices wit and without packaging plus an image of what
            they think a physical store would and should look like. While they were presenting their preferences, they
            were supposed to try to tell the group why they find this particular image / style appealing.
            Over 2/3 of the group went for non-minimalist approach in terms of packaging: serif old-fashioned looking
            font types, ornaments, glass instead of plastis so the stylescape was going into a very traditional feel.
          </li>
          <li>
            The key task was to find a set of relevant Adobe Stock photos that would follow the mood chosen by our human
            helpers. When I saw the image which I used for the landing page, I knew that it was the one. Most of my
            group ended up in awe as the image is exceptional. It is warm, cosy, visually striking in therms of colours
            but also havein the traditional touch (the spoons!). Soon after I was able to find product pictures that
            skipped the packaging, but instead showed the product itself. There was no package designed for the product
            at all, but we imagined that it would be either a 'Weck' glass jar or a dark brown-coloured paperbag.
            Here is what we ended up with for product list: all beutifully consistent.

            <br>
          </li>
          <li>
            The typography should not be overwhelming since the images are so visually rich so we went for a sans serif
            'Montserrat' typeface for the body copy. For the logo though, the choice is Fredericka the Great that
            compliments the traditional feel of the landing page. Voila!

            Lastly, dark mode was chosen to in order to let the images shine and not to introduce unnecessary contrast
            between the image and a potentially light background. Quiet shades of brown seem to have been a reasonable
            solution.

        <h4> Back to UX: Flows! </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Due to tight deadline, I skipped building interactive prototype and instead went for very clean sections
            showing how the user flows work, making sure there there is always somewhere to go once a task has been
            accomplished and that the logic is readable and easy to understand to our junior devs who had never used
            Figma. Simple colour markers and lined between pages did the work.

      <h2>Post delivery testing: results</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The site was built to be responsive for all kinds of devices after a few iterations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Usability tests were passed by all the participants. They were supposed to complete
          a few simple tasks on their laptops and mobile devices and no-one got lost or confused, which is a win.
        </li>
        <li>
          Aesthetics (colours, contrasts, typography) semed appealing to most of the participants.
        </li>
      </ul>
